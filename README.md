Tasty Treats is a modern, responsive recipe web application featuring rich UI,
smart filtering, and a clean UX.

This project was originally built as a team collaboration, where I acted as the
team lead. The full commit history is preserved. I have rewritten the entire
project from scratch, improving structure, optimizing performance, and applying
best practices to solidify my frontend development skills. The project was
optimized for smooth user experience and fast performance, with attention to
accessibility, UI responsiveness, and usability.

Note: This is a frontend-only project using a third-party public recipe API.

## Features

üéûÔ∏è Hero 3D Slider showcasing cooking masterclasses  
üîç Advanced Filtering (category, region, ingredients, time, recipe name)  
üßæ Recipe Modals with:

- Video instructions
- Ratings and hashtags
- Ingredients and steps
- Add to Favorites
- Submit rating via form  
  ‚≠ê Favorites Page with filtering  
  üìÑ Paginated recipe gallery  
  üåì Dark/Light theme toggle  
  ‚úÖ Form validation  
  üé® UI enhancements: animations, custom scrollbars

Special attention was given to UI consistency, form feedback, animated
interactions, and mobile responsiveness.

## Usage

At the top of the application, the header contains two main navigation buttons:
**Home** and **Favorites**. These buttons let users navigate between the main
page and their personal list of saved favorites.

The Hero section features an interactive 3D slider that visually presents
available cooking masterclasses. **Order** Now button opens a modal with a
validated form, where users can request a specific masterclass.

Below the Hero section, users can explore a dynamic recipe gallery with
intuitive pagination for navigating between pages. Filtering is available by
category, region, ingredients, preparation time, and recipe name. Each gallery
item is displayed as a recipe card. Clicking on a card opens a modal with a
large dish image and navigation arrows to browse other recipes images.

To see complete recipe details ‚Äî including video instructions, ingredients,
hashtags, ratings, and cooking steps ‚Äî the user must click the **See Recipe**
button inside the modal. This opens a modal window with detailed information.
There, a **Give a rating** button allows the user to open another modal to
submit a rating via a form.

Any recipe can be added to or removed from the Favorites list using a button in
the detailed modal or **heart-button** on the recipe card.

The Favorites page, accessible from the header, displays a gallery of saved
recipes. Users can filter their saved recipes by category, providing a
convenient way to organize and revisit preferred dishes.

The interface supports dark and light themes, animated transitions, and
validated form inputs to ensure smooth and user-friendly interaction across all
devices.
