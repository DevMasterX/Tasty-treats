ðŸ›  About This Project This project was originally developed as a team
collaboration, where I acted as the team lead. You can explore the full commit
history to see the contributions made by the team.

Now, I am rewriting the project from scratch to improve the code structure,
optimize performance, and implement best practices.

ðŸ“œ Project History The initial version was built as a team project, which you
can review in the commit history.

I am now rebuilding it entirely, demonstrating my individual coding skills and
approach to modern development.

ðŸš€ Goals of the Rewrite Better architecture and clean code

Improved performance and maintainability

Implementation of best practices and new technologies
